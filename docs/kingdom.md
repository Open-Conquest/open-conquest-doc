Each player starts as the ruler of their own kingdom. If they are successful, they can expand this kingdom by conquering other players and constructing cities. The kingdom entity is meant to represent this abstract kingdom which the player rules over including the hierarchy of players in the kingdom, the cities controlled by the kingdom, and any other metadata about the kingdom.

### Expanding a Kingdom's Territory

Every player belongs to a kingdom and whatever cities and territory those players control belong to their kingdom as well. Players can expand their kingdom's territory by constructing or conquering cities effectively increasing the number of cities and territory that belongs to the kingdom.  

### Lordship Hierarchy

Kindgoms start with a single player, the king who founded the kingdom. In an attempt to expand their empire, the king may conquer all of another player's cities. Now the king has conquered all of their cities, including their capital. This means that the king has "control" and "ownerhsip" over this player's former cities. Now, the king can collect resources from the cities, command the cities production, improve & construct buildings in it, etc. The exception to that rule is this player's capital. Players always retain control over their capital even when it has been conquered by another player, so it's advantageous to have an especially strong capital.

By being conquered this player has been forcibly annexed into the conquering player's kingdom. They also become the "vassal" of their conqueror, now their "lord". They may secede from this kingdom and their lord's control but this gives the lord the ability to attack their city once again; players cannot attack members of their kingdom. By remaining the lord's vassal they are subject to the taxes or "land grabs", these are talked about in the city management section, their lord imposes. This can be better than constantly having your city destroyed and it's assumed that the lord will offer protection so long as they are interested in maintaining control of the vassal's cities.

Eventually the lord's territory may grow so vast that it becomes impossible for them to manage by themselves. At this point they may grant ownership of cities to any of their vassals. The lord, at any time, can revoke a vassal's ownership claim to any city. By having ownership of a city a player can control the city, which affords them the abilities outlined in the [<span class="link">city</span>](city.md) page, without having an army stationed in the city, so long as the city isn't being controlled by another player, which would happen if the city were invaded by another player.

The vassal may also have conquests of their own. Any cities they conquer become their own, but their lord may try to take them by revoking their ownership. If the vassal is successful in conquering another player's capital then they become the lord of that player by forced annexation. Relative to their vassal they are a lord, but obviously they retain their same position of power within the lordship hierarchy of the kingdom. A vassal's lord cannot "take" his vassals, but they can, as previously stated, revoke their ownerhsip claims, which could undermine ownership claims the vassal may have granted to their vassals.

### Ownership Hierarchy

Players can either have control over a city, have ownership of a city, or have neither. Having control over a city means that a player has the ability to command that city (e.g. collect resources, train armies, etc.). Having ownership of a city means that a player has the ability to grant ownership of that city. Control can be retained without having an army stationed so long as the player is the lowest member of the ownership hierarchy (explained below), but it is lost once another player successfully attacks the city, which won't be so difficult if there isn't an army to defend it, gaining control and ownership.

A very important aspect of ownership is that it is inherited through lordship. This means that lords have ownership of any of the cities their vassals have ownership of, which gives them they ability to revoke their vassals' ownership claims. Effectively, the lowest member, from the vassal upwards, in the ownership hierarchy has control of the city.

### Forced Annexation

The previous sections mentioned that players can foricbly annex others into their kingdom by way of conquest, but it should be clear at what point that player is annexed and what happens to their territory & vassals. Once that player's capital is invaded and defeated in battle they become the subject of their conqueror and subsequently a member of their conqueror's kingdom. What happens to their other cities which haven't been conquered? It depends on whether or not they're a king. If they aren't, they lose their ownership claims over the unconquered cities and those claims bubble up to their immediate lord. If they are a king, the highest person on the lordship hierarchy in their kingdom, they retain ownership of those cities, but keep in mind that lords, in this case their conqueror, can revoke ownership claims, this process is detailed in the next section. In this case they also retain lordship over their vassals. This means that when a king is conquered their entire kingdom is annexed. It's not as devastating as it seems, they still have the ability to secede, check out the section title 'Secession' for details.

### Annexation

Instead of conquering players, players can invite others to join the kingdom. If they join it will be as the vassal of the player that invited them.

### Lords Managing Vassals' City Ownership

Lords can grant/revoke ownership of the cities they control to their vassals.

Ownership granted is effective immediatley. Once a player accepts an ownership grant they gain control over the city. 

Revoking ownership is not immediate, instead the vassal is given 24 hours to cede ownership of the city or secede from the kingdom. If the vassal doesn't make a decision in 24 hours then ownership will be automatically ceded to the lord and any army the vassal has stationed in the city will march to the vassal's capital.

### Taxation



### Exile

Obviously there will be cases where a lord no longer wants to deal with an unruly vassal. Lords have the option to "exile" their subjects, effectively removing them from the kingdom. When a player is exiled they remain in control of the cities they had ownership of. This means that a lord cannot quickly exile a vassal and immediatley start commanding the cities they'd given to the vassal. A lord can revoke his vassal's city ownership prior to exiling them, but this is another process. Another way for the lord to regain control over the exiled cities is to reconquer them or request ownership of them from the exiled player.

### Secession

If for any reason a player wants to leave their kingdom they can "secede". When a player secedes the cities which they have ownership of are kept as their own. This means that the lord would have to reconquer the cities they had given to their former vassal.
