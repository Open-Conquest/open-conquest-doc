**First and foremost I hope that this project will satisfy people's curiosity for understanding how these sorts of games can be built.**


Open Conquest is a **customizable** 4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate) MMO game. It's **customizable** in the sense that Open Conquest can be easily re-skinned and re-themed, the systems (e.g. combat, trading, unit production, resource collection, territory management) can be modified with minimal effort, and the game's entities (e.g. army units, resources, player characters, cities, buildings, tiles & terrain, etc.) can be easily modified, added, or removed.

For example, say you want to add a new wizard unit to your medieval fantasy themed game. By default, assuming none of the [systems]() have been modified, the only things that would need to be added are:

- [<span class="link">Unit Schemas</span>]() to define the unit's profile & combat properties
- [<span class="link">Production Schemas</span>]() to define the cost of producing the unit in specific buildings
- [<span class="link">Graphic Assets</span>]() to render the unit in each of its possible states on the client

Boom, you've just added a new unit to your game that can be produced by players in their cities, used in their armies and battles, and traded with other players.

The iOS client and API schemas are open-source and available on [Github](https://github.com/Open-Conquest/open-conquest). The backend code will be released on Github under the MIT license 6 months after the official release of Open Conquest on the App Store.
