Players join a world with a single city.

### Producing Resources

One of the main purposes of cities is to produce resources for players. Cities are able to produce resources based on the structures players construct. 

### Producing Units

Similar to resources, units can only be produced by buildings and are collected through the cities which have those buildings.

### Constructing Buildings

Cities' buildings are responsible for enabling them to produce resources, train army units, and improving the defense rating of the city. Each city can have a limited number of buildings and a maximum number of buildings of a certain type.
