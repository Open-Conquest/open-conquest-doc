Open Conquest is a massively multiplayer 4X strategy game where players ultimate goal is to control as much territory as possible. Players achieve this by collecting resources, training armies, building or conquering cities, and forming kingdoms with other players.

As of now, the iOS client and API schemas are open-source and available on [Github](https://github.com/Open-Conquest/open-conquest). In the future, the backend will be open-source as well. I hope that people will satisfy people's curiosity for understanding how these sorts of games can be built.
