An army is a collection of army units which belongs to a player. Players use these armies to attack and attempt to take control over other players' cities. They also station armies in their own cities to defend them.

### Army Units

### Training Armies

The only way for players to build armies is to train army units in their cities. Training these units takes time and resources.

### Battles



### Attacking Cities with Armies

Players use their armies to attack cities. If these attacks are successful and they're able to drive the defending army out of the city then the player gains control over the city.

### Defending Cities with Armies

An army stationed in a city will act as a defensive force if the city is attacked.

### Joining Armies
